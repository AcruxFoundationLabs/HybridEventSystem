# Claim-Driven Event System (CDES)

A flexible and dynamic event-handling system in C# where event listeners evaluate and claim or reject events based on custom logic. Listeners are prioritized, and the dispatcher processes events in priority order, making it lightweight and highly customizable. Perfect for scenarios requiring selective event handling and dynamic priority adjustments.
